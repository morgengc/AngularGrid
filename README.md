Dependencies: angular.js.

##About##

This is an easy frontend grid plugin for angularjs.

Although there are lots of javascript grid plugin such as ng-grid, jqgrid and flexigrid, I also need a grid plugin made by myself.
For one reason, In the face of frequent changes of demand, I need to be able to flexibly modify the grid plugin.
For another reason, build a grid plugin based on angular.js by myself is an interesting process.
